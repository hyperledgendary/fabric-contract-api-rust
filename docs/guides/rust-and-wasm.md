Some thoughts from our journey into Rust and Wasm that may help if you're learning either of these technologies. (Note personal views here)

## Learning Rust

It's fair to say that Rust itself is an amazing language; however it is also fair to say that Rust's learning curve is, well, steep. But the views from top.... wow!
For a quick script to parse some trace data then it's not your preferred tool. However after (between the two of us who've worked on this) 40+ years programming experience our _personal view_ this is the language we'd want to use for rock-solid enterprise production software.

## Learning Wasm

WebAssembly is in idea that in some ways have been around and tried before; the concept is still as valuable even more so today. And the direction Wasm is taking is very exciting.

- For information on [Rust and Wasm ](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/).
   - Please note that section on [what crates may and may not work](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/which-crates-work-with-wasm.html) with Wasm for any dependencies that you use)
